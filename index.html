      <p><strong>15/10 - 22/10</strong></p>

      <p><img
          src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72558704/99911129-33ebe880-2cea-11eb-9769-46a48b1560f5.png" />
      </p>

      <p>This week we were slightly delayed getting the requirements written-up however we do not expect to go past the
        28/10 complete date for these tasks.</p>

      <p><strong>23/10 - 29/10</strong></p>

      <p><img
          src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72558704/99911366-c5a82580-2ceb-11eb-8154-eb9737c171ef.png" />
      </p>

      <p>The requirements were completed by 29/10 which keeps us on track as planned. We have a breakdown of each task
        that needs to be completed and have planned accordingly. We have also discussed which methods and tools we will
        be using; this is yet to be written up however. Furthermore, we decided to start doing a Risk Assessment this
        week; sooner than anticipated in case the risks arise earlier.</p>

      <p><strong>30/10 - 05/11</strong></p>

      <p><img
          src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72558704/99911389-eb352f00-2ceb-11eb-83c6-fd771ef10de9.png" />
      </p>

      <p>Having gotten a diagram for the Abstract Architecture completed, we started implementing as soon as possible as
        it appears writing about the Architecture is going to take us longer than expected. We’ve also completed the
        Risk Assessment and are in good place to identify and mitigate risks should they arise.</p>

      <p><strong>06/11 - 12/11</strong></p>

      <p><img
          src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72558704/99911541-1cfac580-2ced-11eb-8255-bac555408db2.png" />
      </p>

      <p>We have discussed our method and tool selection and have documented our Abstract and Concrete Architecture
        representations - though these need to be related to the requirements yet.</p>

      <p><strong>13/11 - 19/11</strong></p>

      <p><img
          src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72558704/99911785-93e48e00-2cee-11eb-8fa6-1c2648e760c7.png" />
      </p>

      <p>We have completed our representation of the Concrete Architecture as the Implementation is well under way; no
        changes to the Architecture of the game will be changed at this point. We are yet to discuss unimplemented
        requirements but that should be done over the weekend.</p>

      <p><strong>19/11 - 25/11</strong></p>

      <h3>Sprint updates for Assessment 2</h3>

      <p><strong>11/01 - 20/01</strong></p>

      <p><img src="Images/11jan-20jan.png" /></p>

      <p>The first week of the term was exam period, so we didn’t do anything regarding the ENG1 project.</p>

      <p><strong>21/01</strong></p>

      <p><img src="Images/21jan.png" /></p>

      <p>During the first practical, our team:
      <ul>
        <li>Forked Github for group takeover</li>
        <li>Got resources for assessment 2</li>
        <li>Looked over and tried to understand their code</li>
        <li>Made a Trello board for Assessment 2</li>
        <li>Emailed the module leaders in lieu of a customer meeting</li>
        <li>Answered emails and provide service to other groups who inherited our project</li>
        <li>Caught up members with practical progress and assessment 2 progress</li>
        <li>Made new tasks for all members</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p><strong>23/01 - 24/01</strong></p>

      <p><img src="Images/23jan-24jan.png" /></p>

      <p>During this period, our team worked on implementing the missing feature from Assessment 1 (Boat Attributes) and
        added the features required for Assessment 1 (Difficulty, saving, and power-ups).</p>

      <p><strong>25/01 - 27/01</strong></p>

      <p><img src="Images/25jan-27jan.png" /></p>

      <p>We got started on Software Testing and cloned the website.</p>

      <p><strong>28/01 - 02/02</strong></p>

      <p><img src="Images/28jan-2feb.png" /></p>

      <p>Began work on documentation for Assessment 2 deliverables and editing the previous team’s documents.</p>

      <p><strong>03/02 - 07/02</strong></p>

      <p><img src="Images/3feb-7feb.png" </p>

      <p>Finishing touches on the Testing, Change Report and Implementation Documents.</p>

The first one in the TM_STATE_FLOW is more representative as it includes GUI colour & contrast changes for easier viewing experience as discussed in “Manual Playtesting” in Test2, “Background and text UI changes” in Impl2 as well as below in the manual testing document in “TM_POSITIVE_UX”. <b>These GIFs are not representative of the quality or smoothness of the game due to format.</b> Please play the game for the full experience.</p>

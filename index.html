<p><strong>15/10 - 22/10</strong></p>

<p>This week we were slightly delayed getting the requirements written-up however we do not expect to go past the 28/10 complete date for these tasks.</p>

<p><strong>23/10 - 29/10</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72558704/99911366-c5a82580-2ceb-11eb-8154-eb9737c171ef.png" /></p>

<p>The requirements were completed by 29/10 which keeps us on track as planned. We have a breakdown of each task that needs to be completed and have planned accordingly. We have also discussed which methods and tools we will be using; this is yet to be written up however. Furthermore, we decided to start doing a Risk Assessment this week; sooner than anticipated in case the risks arise earlier.</p>

<p><strong>30/10 - 05/11</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72558704/99911389-eb352f00-2ceb-11eb-83c6-fd771ef10de9.png" /></p>

<p>Having gotten a diagram for the Abstract Architecture completed, we started implementing as soon as possible as it appears writing about the Architecture is going to take us longer than expected. Weâ€™ve also completed the Risk Assessment and are in good place to identify and mitigate risks should they arise.</p>

<p><strong>06/11 - 12/11</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72558704/99911541-1cfac580-2ced-11eb-8255-bac555408db2.png" /></p>

<p>We have discussed our method and tool selection and have documented our Abstract and Concrete Architecture representations - though these need to be related to the requirements yet.</p>

<p><strong>13/11 - 19/11</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72558704/99911785-93e48e00-2cee-11eb-8fa6-1c2648e760c7.png" /></p>

<p>We have completed our representation of the Concrete Architecture as the Implementation is well under way; no changes to the Architecture of the game will be changed at this point. We are yet to discuss unimplemented requirements but that should be done over the weekend.</p>

<p><strong>19/11 - 25/11</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72558704/100144113-35561600-2e8e-11eb-92dc-711e96209e2a.png" /></p>

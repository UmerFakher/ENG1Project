## Test location 
All automatic test source files are contained in the [src folder](https://github.com/UmerFakher/ENG1Project/tree/master/tests/src/com/dragonboatrace) and are organised acording to what area of the program they test. For example, the tests for tools are in [src/.../tools](https://github.com/UmerFakher/ENG1Project/tree/master/tests/src/com/dragonboatrace/tools).
## Test Status
The current test and build status for all these tests is shown with the badges at the top of this README. All of the tests were run with the included gradle files on a virtualised windows machine and are linked to the current state of the master branch.
